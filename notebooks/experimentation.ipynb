      "In The Character Growth Manifesto, we not only provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of character development but also offer practical strategies to empower them in taking control of their lives. One such strategy is the creation of a daily routine that fosters personal growth and self-improvement. Here is a suggested daily routine that can help you on your journey to becoming the person you aspire to be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Morning Reflection and Goal Setting:\n",
      "Start your day by taking a few moments to reflect on your goals and aspirations. Write down your intentions for the day and visualize yourself achieving them. This practice will help you set a positive mindset and focus your energy on what truly matters to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mindfulness or Meditation:\n",
      "Engage in a mindfulness or meditation practice to cultivate a sense of calm and clarity. This can involve deep breathing exercises, guided meditation, or simply sitting in silence and observing your thoughts. By practicing mindfulness, you can enhance your self-awareness and develop a greater sense of presence in your daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Physical Exercise:\n",
      "Engaging in regular physical exercise is crucial for both your physical and mental well-being. Whether it's going for a run, practicing yoga, or hitting the gym, make time for physical activity that suits your preferences and abilities. Exercise not only boosts your energy levels but also releases endorphins, which can improve your mood and overall outlook on life.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Learning and Personal Growth:\n",
      "Allocate time each day for learning and personal growth. This can involve reading books, listening to podcasts, or taking online courses that align with your interests and goals. Continuously expanding your knowledge and skills will not only enhance your personal development but also open up new opportunities for growth and success.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Reflection and Journaling:\n",
      "Take a few moments each day to reflect on your experiences, emotions, and lessons learned. Consider keeping a journal to document your thoughts and insights. Reflecting on your day allows you to gain a deeper understanding of yourself, identify patterns, and make adjustments as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Practice Gratitude:\n",
      "Cultivate a mindset of gratitude by expressing appreciation for the blessings in your life. Each day, take a moment to acknowledge and write down three things you are grateful for. This practice can shift your focus towards positivity and increase your overall sense of well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Connect with Others:\n",
      "Make time to connect with loved ones, friends, or mentors who support your personal growth journey. Engage in meaningful conversations, seek guidance, and share your experiences. Surrounding yourself with positive and like-minded individuals can provide valuable support and encouragement along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Evening Reflection and Self-Care:\n",
      "Before ending your day, engage in an evening reflection practice. Review your accomplishments, challenges, and areas for improvement. Practice self-care activities that promote relaxation and rejuvenation, such as reading a book, taking a bath, or practicing a hobby you enjoy. Prioritize getting enough sleep to ensure you wake up refreshed and ready for the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, this suggested daily routine is just a starting point. Feel free to customize it to suit your individual needs and preferences. The key is to be consistent and committed to your personal growth journey. By incorporating these practices into your daily routine, you will gradually take control of your life and experience lasting, positive change.\n"

    "### Variable Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Variables\n",
    "- **Chunk Sizes:** The number of characters per grouping of text. A document is broken down into a set of chunks containing its text.\n",
    "- **Chunk Overlap:** The character overlap between chunks. This may help with contextual builidng, such that chunks are not seen as seperate entities but contains links to each other.\n",
    "- **Embeddings:** The models that transform text chunks into vectors (text to vector models). These capture the language context and aim to encapsulate that within a numerical vector.\n",
    "- **Embedding Names:** Shorthand names for the embedding models for simplification when the results are saved.\n",
    "- **Dimensions:** The dimension of the vectors. This is linked to the embedding model used, such that the dimension matches the output vector size of the embedding model.\n",
    "- **Models:** The LLM models used.\n",
    "- **Model Names:** Shorthand model names for the simplification of the results when saved to file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector Search Variables\n",
    "- **Search Types:** The type of search within the vector database, based on the user query. The following link provides more in-depth understanding of aximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) vs Similarity Search: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/\n",
    "    - MMR: Search optimizes similarity to the user query while maintaining contextual diversity.\n",
    "    - Similarity Search: Optimizes for vector similarity to the user query only.\n",
    "- **K's:** The number of vectors (context pieces) to be returned by the vector database search. \n",
    "- **Lambda Multipliers:** This parameter relates to MMR search only (this has already been accounted for in the experiments). The parameter controls the amount of diversity included within the search. 1 includes minimal diversity through to 0 introducing maximum diversity.\n",
    "- **filter:** The filter allows the user to filter the search results using metadata. Remember the available metadata includes: title, author, and source (path to document). Filter parameter should be included in `experiment_exe()` in the following manner `search_kwargs={'filter': {'title':'tracking'}}`. The below link contains an exampe of a filter being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following link showcases the vector search results in a more in-depth manner: https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/how_to/vector_db_qa\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important\n",
    "Please review the following docs for use of the filter: https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/how_to/vector_db_qa\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The temperature variable is not included in all llm models. As such, when a model is capable of taking the parameter, please hardcode it into the `models` list as is done in `ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0.5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** Please add your local path for the GPT4All model when running the experiments. Specifically this line `GPT4All(model='/home/travisdawson/.cache/gpt4all/ggml-all-MiniLM-L6-v2-f16.bin')`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 3:** The open-source models such as GPT4All have context window limitations. By providing an increased k or a long query, or even repeated queries the model will begin blocking requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 4:** The results are written to the file `notebooks/exp_results/result.csv`. The file is a csv file for easy visualization and analysis using Pandas."

      "Developing a daily routine can be a powerful tool in taking control of your life and fostering character growth. Here is a rough outline of a daily routine that can empower you to make positive changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Morning Reflection: Start your day by reflecting on your character development goals. Ask yourself questions like, \"What character qualities do I want to embody today?\" and \"How can I apply these qualities in my interactions and actions?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mindfulness Practice: Engage in a mindfulness practice such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. This can help you cultivate self-awareness, manage stress, and enhance your focus for the day ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Journaling: Take a few minutes to journal about your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Use the prompts provided in the manifesto to explore your character strengths and areas for improvement. Celebrate moments when you demonstrated desired character qualities and identify missed opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Goal Setting: Set specific character development goals for the day. Consider the situations or challenges where you can practice and express these qualities. Write down the actions you will take to embody these qualities and visualize how it will make you feel when you succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Engage in Character Projects: Incorporate character-building activities into your daily routine. Choose projects or tasks that push you out of your comfort zone and align with your growth objectives. This could involve taking on new responsibilities at work, engaging in community service, or pursuing personal hobbies that require courage, resilience, or empathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Reflect and Evaluate: At the end of the day, reflect on your experiences. Ask yourself questions like, \"How did I embody my desired character qualities today?\" and \"What challenges did I face, and how did I handle them?\" Evaluate your progress and identify areas for further growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Gratitude Practice: Cultivate gratitude by expressing appreciation for the positive aspects of your day. Write down three things you are grateful for, whether they are related to your character development or not. This practice can help shift your focus towards the positive and reinforce your commitment to personal growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, this is just a rough daily routine, and you can adapt it to suit your needs and preferences. The key is to create a structure that supports your character development goals and encourages regular reflection and action.\n",
